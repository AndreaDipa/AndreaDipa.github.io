Andrea Di Paolo, 24 November 2022

Assignment:
<ul>
    <li>Consider R (radius), A(angle) uniform rv's and use them as random polar coordinates on a plane. Determine the empirical distribution of the corresponding Cartesian coordinates (X,Y).</li>
    <li>Search for the methods to generate Normal rv's X from uniform rv's, and simulate the following distribution: X, X², X/Y², X²/Y², X/Y.</li>
</ul>
