# <mark> Distribution </mark>
The distribution provides a parameterized mathematical function that can be used to calculate the probability for any individual observation from the sample space. 
From a practical perspective, we can think of a distribution as a function that describes the relationship between observations in a sample space.
It is simply a collection of data, or scores, on a variable. Usually, these scores are arranged in order from smallest to largest and then they can be presented graphically.

   A univariate distribution is defined as a distribution that involves just one random variable. For instance, suppose we wish to model the distribution of returns on an asset, such as a holding of stocks; such a model would be a univariate distribution.
  
  </td>
  <td>
A multivariate distribution refers to the probability distribution of a group of random variables. For example, a multivariate normal distribution is used to specify the probabilities of returns of a group of n stocks. This has relevance because the returns of different stocks in the group influence each other’s behaviour, that is, the behaviour of one random variable in the group is influenced by the behaviour of another variable.

# <mark> Conditional distribution </mark>
If X and Y are two jointly distributed random variables, then the conditional distribution of Y given X is the probability distribution of Y when X is known to be a certain value.
