<ul>
    <li> Create a distribution from the data obtained by the program WireShark by reading the CSV file generated by the program.</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->
For this assignement I captured some packets via wireshark in my home network. After a bit of research, I extracted the captured packets into csv format. Finally I parsed them with the parser I created for the last homework and calculated the distribution for the variables. This process is very useful for analysing traffic in a network, in particular to check for anomalies and for forensic analysis.
